The global population is projected to see an increase of 2.3 billion people by 2050\. If current trends hold, a majority of the 9 million would live in cities and only around 3 percent would have any direct role in the production of their food. [^fn1]

To support the population growth industrial agricultural will need to increase crop yield by 100%. [^fn12] Most of land that is suitable for farming is already being used, so 90 percent of the necessary increase is expected to come from increased yield; however, annual yield increases have stagnated to only half of the historical average. Agricultural scientists are facing new and novel problems stemming from the techniques and practices that have helped feed and sustain the twentieth century's population boom.[^fn8]

The primary agricultural ideology was, and to some extent still is, that increasingly large, monocrop farms are the most cost effective way to increase yield to feed a global population. Monoculture farming facilitates maximizing both profits and crop yield by minimizing the competition for nutrients between plants, reducing the amount of specialized machinery required to operate, and simplifying the processes of fertilizing and managing the health of crops. [^fn5][^fn6] However, the practice has some serious environmental and operational implications.

The reliance on monocrops led to farms filled with nutrient depleted soil. Increased use of pesticides, necessary to keep up with increasing demand have damaged soil ecology even further due to the indiscriminate destruction of fungi and bacteria, and crop yield has largely plateaued.[^fn3][^fn4]

Though advances in farming technology and practice have managed to sustain a relatively massive population, the input costs are still drastic and unsustainable. Today 40% of land and 85% of water withdrawal is used solely to grow food.

Furthermore, the increased production of food tends not to reach those who need it most. In fact, it is likely that those who need the food most are those that are affected least by recent technological advances. The International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) has commented that "despite significant scientific and technological achievements in our ability to increase agricultural productivity, we have been less attentive to some of the unintended social and environmental consequences of our achievements." Beyond the wastefulness and unsustainable nature of industrial agriculture the consolidation and monopolization of the food industry is one of the contributors that impact the inequity of food dispersal that is particularly worrying. [^fn16]

Agriculture has become much less accessible and little effort has been made to make small-scale, personal farming easier to engage in. The number of farms globally has shrunk drastically, in the US alone the number of farms has halved over the last 50 years decreasing by over 2 million. [^fn15] Farm land has also become much less dispersed, and the average size of farms has increased dramatically despite 85 percent of farms being less than 2 hectares.

The necessity for higher yield farming accessible by many and the quickly approaching projected natural maximum capacity of industrial agriculture has led to a rapid shift toward sustainable agriculture.[^fn7]

With the looming global food crisis, environmental impact of rising global temperatures, and ever growing global population, how can we improve on the process of growing food? One Japanese company, Mirai, working with GE has spearheaded an experiment proposing indoor hydroponic gardens. After purchasing a retired 25,000 square foot Sony semi-conductor factory plant physiologist Shigeharu Shimamura began converting it into the world's largest indoor farm illuminated by LED. The constantly lit, environmentally controlled grow room immediately showed some of the benefits of the practice. Produce waste decreased from nearly 50 percent to just 10, productivity per square foot was nearly 100 times the average, and water usage was just 1 percent of what a conventional farm would consume. The success of their flagship factory has led to increased interest in creating factories all over the world, suggesting that hydroponics could be the future of agriculture.

Hydroponics is a method of growing crops using only a nutrient solution administered directly to the roots of the plants being grown and an inert medium used to suspend the roots of the plants into the given solution. Crops grown hydroponically use significantly less water, yield many times more than their soil-grown counterparts, and can grow healthy, nutrient-rich vegetables despite inhospitable soil conditions or temperatures.

The promise of more sustainable produce has led to an increased adoption of hydroponics both commercially and by amateur gardeners all over the world; however, there are two incredibly important complications that have kept soilless gardens from being widely accessible.

Firstly, there is a large learning curve associated with growing plants hydroponically. In comparison to tradition soil gardens, hydroponic gardens require strict monitoring of growing conditions, nutrient solutions, and root health. Furthermore, hydroponic gardens are prone to a collection of diseases and pests that are not commonly seen in soil gardens.

Second, hydroponic gardens are costly. The initial start up costs, cost of labor, and cost of upkeep are all significantly higher for hydroponic gardens. In commercial grow operations this cost is often offset by the greater yield, but the necessity of more higher-paid operators is a serious business consideration. For smaller, hobbyist gardeners looking to build a hydroponic garden in a community space or at home the increased cost can be incredibly prohibitive. Even if the garden's yield outweighs the cost of materials, the opportunity cost associated with constantly monitoring and servicing a hydroponic garden is often impossible to commit to.

In many ways these two glaring problems are not entirely avoidable. The initial costs of materials and continuing cost of maintenance and upkeep will most likely always be more than a traditional soil garden. however, I believe that the benefits of hydroponic gardens are enticing enough that by lessening the burden of monitoring and upkeep the prospect of hydroponic gardens could become immediately more viable and likely less expensive as well.

Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is a sub-genre of hydroponic gardens that utilize a shallow film of nutrient enriched water running separate channels on a slight decline to deliver sustenance to plant's roots, which are suspended in a medium absent of any nutrients on the top of the aforementioned channels. NFT gardens provide an ideal environment in which plants are consistently exposed to water, oxygen, and nutrients.

NFT is considered an active hydroponic method because it relies on mechanical pumps to continuously deliver recirculated water and nutrients to the plant's roots. Other methods, like Deep Water Culture and Kratky, rely on capillary or wick systems. Though maintenance and monitoring of passive systems is generally much simpler, these systems generally subject their plant's roots to constant submersion. As a result, passive systems generally prohibit the flow of oxygen. Furthermore, unlike NFT, many hydroponic systems are not able to recover the unused nutrients.

With a good setup Nutrient Film Technique gardens will consistently produce high-quality vegetables at high yields. Certain crops, especially those that are not as reliant on their roots for structural support, can produce even higher yields than other hydroponic methods. However, this comes at a significant cost. Because NFT gardens are so reliant on the constant flow of nutrients they also require constant monitoring. These gardens are susceptible to a handful of disastrous issues regarding flow that are capable the plants affected within a matter of hours. In the case that the the pump supplying water from the reservoir to the channels were to lose power the plants would dry up and die within a few hours. Similarly because of the tight plumbing and inevitability of sediment being introduced into the reservoir a clogged line could kill all of the plants in a single channel or even an entire garden if it was the main line. A less dire, but still pressing complication occurs because as the plants consume the nutrients from the solution some of the water evaporates through the openings at the top of each channel. If the amount of water that sweats out of the system is greater than the consumption rate of the nutrients, then the plants are at risk of dying from being exposed to a pH imbalanced solution.

In an effort to explore methods of making hydroponic gardens, a high-yield, sustainable, space saving means of growing fresh produce, more available I built Victor -- a collection of services used in conjunction to mitigate the amount of time taking measurements about the growing conditions of your garden, provide you with real time alerts in the case that something seems to be going wrong, and give you an interface with managing some of the upkeep remotely. I believe this tool can easily cut back both the total number of hours required to maintain a hydroponic garden and lower the barrier of entry by providing gardeners with baseline numbers to compare to and programmable warnings.
